### Challenge Name: Save The Gifts

Website has an IDOR vulnerability that allows users to see details for other users. The user_id parameter can be changed, allowing an attacker to see details of users other than themselves.

The vulnerability in this web application is in the `user_id` parameter. A user can submit any user_id allowing for enumeration and information gathering. It could also allow an attacker to see data not intended for them. Mitigations would include a server-side check to ensure the user_id of the logged in user is the same as the parameter.
